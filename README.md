# Immunization Charts (R Version)

## Introduction

This repository contains the **R implementation** of the immunization charts project.

It provides an approach for generating custom immunization history charts, which can be incorporated into notice letters for overdue **Immunization of School Pupils Act (ISPA)**-mandated or **Child Care and Early Years Act (CCEYA)**-mandated immunizations.

⚠️ **Note:** A newer version of this project is now available. This R version remains accessible for reference and legacy use, but users are encouraged to explore the updated release for the latest features and improvements.

## Usage
### Environment
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is used with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (via [rmarkdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/index.html)) for PDF generation. [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) is used in this repository to assist with accurately reproducing the R project environment.

### Data
This project is intended to be used with data extracts from [Panorama PEAR](https://accessonehealth.ca/).

Input files, in `xlsx` format should be organized in a subfolder `input` (out of caution, input and output folders are `.gitignore`d, and need to be recreated by the user). Each `xlsx` file should have a shared format. It's suggested that `xlsx` exports from Panorama PEAR are batched by client birth year. The report must at minimum include "Client ID", "Date of Birth", and a string representation of the immunization history, in a column "Received Agents". To create this immunization history string, a "Repeater" Data Container must be used in the Panorama PEAR report builder. The repeater will be formatted as:
1. `[PresentationView].[Immunization Received].[Date Administered]`
2. Text box with space, dash, and a space (` - `)
3. `[PresentationView].[Immunization Received].[Immunizing Agent]`

### Functionality
`make_charts.R` contains data processing steps, with some functions relating specifically to formatting information for use in LaTeX code separated out into `latex_utilities.R`. Based on your particular report, adjust the `col_types` and `select`ed columns for your particular data file(s) in `make_charts.R`.

`chart_template.Rmd` allows for generation of PDF files using LaTeX, by inserting processed data elements into LaTeX code. This LaTeX code can be customized and expanded upon such that the immunization chart is an element in a larger letter with:
- Addressee information that can be shown in the window of an envelope
- Public Health Unit branding
- List of overdue diseases
- Public Health Unit-specific instructions for updating vaccination records or consultation on vaccination
- Any other customizations that can enhance client experience or streamline vaccine record management operations

This project currently supports charts that include any combination of CCEYA and ISPA-mandated vaccinations, in addition to HPV and Hepatitis B recommended vaccines. 

These diseases can be re-ordered to suit your application, through modifications in the parameters section in `make_charts.R`. Any diseases left off generated charts will be collapsed into the 'Other' diseases column.

`vaccine_reference.xlsx` includes the specific vaccine values currently supported, and the diseases they immunize against for the purposes of indicator dots on the immunization history chart output. Create an issue or pull request to add more vaccines.

An `output` subfolder should also be created for generated PDFs, and a leger of vaccines detected in the `Received Agents` in your data file(s).

Note that immunization history for a single client can exceed a single page. For large mailing campaigns utilizing a envelope stuffing machine, you will need to separate these clients out from those with records that fit on a single page.

### Testing
`test.R` generates a data file with vaccination history for a single client, which can be used with `make_charts.R` with default parameters. This client receives every vaccine in `vaccine_reference.xlsx` (one per week). Running `test.R` will create `input` and `output` subdirectories, create the test data, and generate a PDF notice for the client.

## Contributing
Fixes or additions to the `vaccine_reference.xlsx`, dependency updates, documentation improvements, and additions of tests will enhance the usability and reliability of this project and are welcome contributions.
